# cbc-aes-128

Wrote the CBC block cipher using AES 128 bit encryption in C

* used AES 128 ni from intel, so the encryption and decryption is actually done on the processor.
* used ansi X.923 padding standard

Only theoretically secure. I'm sure my spaghetti code has some functional vulnerability :).
